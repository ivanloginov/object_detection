## Continuous object detection with Raspberry Pi 4 and 8MP camera

Making use of TensorFlow Lite library to detect objects with Raspberry 8MP camera.

#### Plan:
1. Detect objects with custom dataset
2. Output object coordinates only on image change
3. Speed up detection with Google Coral

#### TODO:
1. LabelIMG for custom dataset
